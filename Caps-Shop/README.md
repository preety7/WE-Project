# E-Commerce-Website
Shopping website using PHP, HTML, SQL, and CSS.


This was a project that I completed in two days for a PHP boot-camp I took part in. The challenge was given to us on Friday and by Sunday we needed to have a finished product.

The challenges were pretty straightforward: Create a working E-Commerce website, with fully functional basket system and a fleshed out user experience.
This meant Logins/Admins/User Creation and more. It was a fun project and an awesome way to get introduced to PHP and web development.

After downloading the repo the user can start at `home.html`. However, if there's not a local server running, the website won't store information in `[_SESSION]` variables.

## Here's the home page. 
It's a little bit silly, but hey, it was a beginner project so might as well have some fun.

## The Basket
This is the part I am most proud of. The basket is fully functional. You may fill your basket with items from the shop and you must be logged in to purchase the items.
If you try to purchase without logging in, you will be prompted with a login/create user page. Once you follow the steps and get logged in, you can check your basket and your items will still be there!
It may seem trivial to more experienced web developers, but it was a fun problem to tackle.
